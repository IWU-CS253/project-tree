Responsibilities
----------------------
The Original Plan for this iteration was as follows.

Grace - Work on adding an edit button on the app's display for all
characters, as well as adding functionality for each edit button.

Azeem - Work on adding a delete button on the app's display for all
characters, as well as adding functionality for each edit button.

Jeff - Work on implementing basic CSS and styling into our Character Tree Page.

Josh - Work on creating an extra attribute for relationship descriptions, as well as add a user feature
that allows them to input their relationship descriptions into their own relationships. 

Due to various circumstances (group member dropping, confusion with assignments (one of the issues made on Github wasn't clear that the delete 
and edit functions were meant to be two separate responsibilites, and there was some miscomunication as well), and just wanting reassignment)
Our plan's responsibilites had to change.
