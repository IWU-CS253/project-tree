Team Contract
---------------

##### Tree Group: Grace, Zach, Jeff, Azeem, Josh 

### Leadership

#### Responsibilities:

- Responsible for *submitting* any assignments due 
- In charge of contacting team members as necessary; organizing meetings outside of normal schedule
- Responsible for reaching out to team members if they have not "checked in", or for working towards a solution if a check-in reveals problems
  - Solutions may include the leader picking up the slack, the leader reassigning the work throughout the group, or having an emergency meeting to figure out the best plan
- Responsible for completing reports, which can be in part compiled from check-ins and commits
- Point of contact for the team and for Prof. Liffiton

- 11/22-11/28: Grace
- 11/29-12/5: Josh
- 12/6-12/12: Jeff

### Decision-Making
- Decisions with disagreement will be made by majority ruleâ€”there are five of us, so in general there will not be ties
- In the absence of all five when a decision must be made that could result in a tie, ties will be resolved via dice or flipping a coin

### Group Member Expectations

#### Check-Ins
- Each group member is responsible for giving a brief check-in on work progress or any potential issues every Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday
- Check-ins should include:
  - What they have accomplished
  - What they are working on, and when
  - Any technical issues
  - Any outside issues the group should be aware of that may affect progress
- Because of the frequency of check-ins, not everyone will have "accomplished" something every check-in, *which is okay*

#### Responsibilities
- Show up to meetings punctually; communicate with the group if you are unable to *in advance* when possible
- Fulfill assigned tasks by their deadlines; if there are problems, communicate with group via check-ins and just reaching out
- Be available to contact when possible. Check discord channel at least once a day.

### Dealing with Group Members Not Meeting Obligations
- Each team member is entitled to one iteration's worth of grace. If there is trouble, it is expected that they communicate with the leader or the group as a whole via check-ins and direct communication.
- During a consecutive week of someone not completing their share (or if the rest of the group agrees there is a problem that needs addressing), the next meeting (or in emergency meeting if necessary) the group should discuss if they feel the circumstances justify the lack of contribution
  - If it is determined that there is a genuine problem with the team member's lack of contribution, they will be spoken to by the group and given a "warning"
  - If the problem persists, the leader will reach out to Prof. Liffiton to try and find a solution
- If someone stops communicating (no check-ins, does not respond to discord / email, and does not come to class) for 3+ days, it will be brought to Prof. Liffiton.
- If they stop communicating for 1-2 days, we will have a team meeting to address the problem before we have to pass it on to Mark.
