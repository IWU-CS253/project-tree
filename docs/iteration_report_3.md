# Iteration 3

Original Plan
---------------------
- Grace was assigned to finish the homepage that Josh started working on, as well as doing additional user interface
work on the show_tree page.
- Jeff was assigned implementing the ability for a user to create and access multiple separate trees from the homepage,
which would be stored in the database as a tree table with relevant information, and with tree_id columns in all other
tables.
- Josh was assigned to work on creating a system to generate relationships that are derived from existing relationships
a tree
- Zach was assigned to implement relationship deletion

Completed Work
---------------------
- Homepage completed with full functionality
- Updated and improved styling and layout for show_tree page and edit_character page 
- The multiple tree functionality
  - Create and name trees from the homepage, and access and edit any tree in the database at present.
- A homepage button on the show_tree page
- Relationship deletion and unit tests completed
- Shift back to id-based DB model instead of natural key based model

Planned and Unfinished
---------------------
- Completed creation of graph for implicit creation, and added implicit siblings and parentsâ€”however, did not fully 
finish relationship implicits generation, as it does not yet interact with relationships as they exist in the DB.

Difficulties
---------------------
- Creation of multiple trees involved reworking database and site navigation model, and by extension every single 
function, which proved challenging.
- Creating algorithms is hard.
- Need to be more careful with git merge conflict resolution and with keeping unit tests up-to-date

Adjustments and Changes
---------------------
- Discussed techniques for tree_display; plan to use javascript library Vis
- Returned to an id-based database model
- Considering using implicit relationships graph tools to help with display 

Important Take-aways
---------------------
- Different methods (GET and POST) handle arguments differently (e.g. request.form vs. request.args)
- Manual CSS styling and Bootstrap will conflict if you're not careful

Next Iteration Plan
---------------------
Iteration Week 4 User Stories:

- Finish implicit relationships - Josh
- Tree Display: Characters & Relationships
  - Create functions to pass data from the tree to Vis: Zach 
  - Integrate the Vis into the show_tree page: Grace
  - Use Vis to show characters as nodes and relationships as edges: Grace 
  - Style / edit display to show relevant information about characters (eg. names): Jeff

Our assignments are a bit nebulous at the moment, as we are still not certain what the steps will be for creating and
integrating a Vis display. These will become more concrete when we figure out the exact steps at our meeting on Tuesday.
